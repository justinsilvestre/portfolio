## A user experience for language learners that's **offline-first**, **archive-friendly**, and **anti-enshittification**

Simply put, Knowclip is a tool to help language-learners to generate rich audio flashcards out of video files in their target language. The Knowclip interface allows users to quickly make clips and export them in the form of a digital flashcard deck compatible with the open-source "spaced repetition" app [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), complete with images and audio clips from the video. When the video has subtitles available, the process of creating flashcards can be completely automated. Additionally, subtitles activate the instant-lookup popover dictionary feature, which lets users look up words on the fly. This workflow requires no signup, no login, no Internet connection. Likewise, flashcard drills with Anki require no Internet either. Therefore, when learning a language with Knowclip and Anki, **it is possible to conduct the entire process offline**, besides the initial step of downloading the apps.

Of course, the user experience still benefits from an Internet connection. Without it, the app won't receive any new updates with new features, UX improvements, etc. But as a matter of principle, users are never _forced_ to update. If they are happy with the experience as is, they are free to abstain from changes to it. This makes apps like Knowclip and Anki **immune to the ["enshittification"](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/nov/26/enshittification-macquarie-dictionary-word-of-the-year-explained)** that plagues the modern web. Since Knowclip and Anki are both free and open source, with every release ever published available for download on Github, users can rest assured that they'll be able to continue using their software as they like it for years to come.

It's inevitable that one day, Knowclip and Anki will cease being developed, and these apps will no longer be compatible with modern operating systems. But this sort of offline-first workflow of these applications means that **the user experience is archivable**. In the far future, it will still be possible to open up Knowclip and Anki files successfully and _without any security risks_ by running an offline version of an old archived operating system. It doesn't even require old hardware, since virtual machines allow old operating systems to be run easily and, at least for most Linux and Windows OSs, free of charge. As long as such virtual machines exist&mdash;whether that means tens, hundreds, or thousands of years&mdash;it will remain possible to run this software and use it in the exact way it was intended to be used.
