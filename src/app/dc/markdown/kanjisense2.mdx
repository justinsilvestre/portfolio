## Using the _graphic structure_ of characters to orient learners on their kanji journey

The standard way to monitor learners' progress in acquiring the kanji involves gathering _a progressive set of character lists_, like those used in Japanese grade schools. The _number of characters_ from a given list which a student can read/write can then be used as a heuristic for their general kanji knowledge. Textbooks and other resources for Japanese learners often present kanji in a format similar to this:

- 80 kanji from primary grade 1:
  <KanjisenseKanjiList chars="一右雨円王音下火花貝学気九休玉金空月犬見五口校左三山子四糸字耳七車手十出女小上森人水正生青夕石赤千川先早草足村大男竹中虫町天田土二日入年白八百文木本名目立力林六" />

As is clear from one look at the lists, the characters tend to get progressively more complex in structure as the levels progress. That progression in complexity is a result of the **_compound graphical structure_ of the vast majority of kanji**, especially those less frequently used kanji that are learned at higher levels of Japanese study. However, Japanese course materials generally don't discuss this aspect of character structure explicitly, except maybe in passing. Instead, they teach kanji one by one, as arbitrary shapes to be learned one after the other. This method of presenting characters on an individual basis makes it easy for authors to fit them into course materials, but for learners, it conceals **major qualitative differences in character acquisition at different skill levels**.

<KanjisenseAtomicComponentsList />

The road to kanji literacy is not one long, monotonous course of learning one arbitrary shape after another. The compound graphical structure of most kanji makes the experience of learning kanji much more like a journey over a hill. First, one goes uphill with great effort as one learns **the basic shapes that make up the kanji**. Second, one goes downhill, with much less effort, as one has only to learn **how those shapes are combined**. Kanjisense allows learners to easily get a sense of where they are on this journey by presenting the kanji and their graphical components in the context of various structural groups.

The most important of these groups are the [270 "atomic components"](https://kanjisense.com/browse/atomic-components) which form the basic building blocks of all 3500 kanji needed for adult-level literacy in Japanese. While the basic idea of graphically analyzing the kanji has been used in kanji courses before, Kanjisense distinguishes itself in this particular method of graphic analysis, as well as in the way it introduces the kanji and their components in a **non-linear presentation**. Since Kanjisense functions as a dictionary app, learners are free to explore the characters in any order they wish.

This means that **learners of all levels** can look up kanji as they encounter them in their studies and instantly find its graphic relationships with other characters. At the beginner level, Kanjisense shows learners how the first characters they encounter are powerful building-blocks they will see used in more complex characters later on. As for more advanced learners, Kanjisense shows them exactly how their knowledge from their earlier kanji studies can help make learning new compound characters much easier. These insights can serve as a motivating force for kanji learners from the start of their journey until the very final stretches.
