## Helping learners navigate the murky shores of literacy in Japanese

Those who embark on the journey of learning to read Japanese have no choice but to go in blind. Even if they are aware that Chinese characters are used in the Japanese script, they will have no concept of what it means to "learn" a given _kanji_ (as the characters are called in Japanese). This is not just due to inexperience&mdash;in fact, **the question of what it means to "know" a given kanji has no straightforward answer**. Learning a new character is not as simple as learning a new letter in the alphabet. The kanji don't exactly stand for sounds, and (contrary to popular belief) they don't exactly stand for words, either. Many kanji operate unpredictably on one or more levels of meaning, including lexical, morphemic, and phonological. It is only by becoming familiar with a vast number of usages for hundreds of characters that one can start to gain an intuition as to what it means to "know" an arbitrary kanji.

With no way of _knowing what they don't know_, beginners are thus liable to underestimate the difficulty of the task ahead. At first, it may seem like smooth sailing, since the first set of characters students learn, the _kana_ syllabaries, are as regular and predictable as any alphabet. But then, after mastering those characters over the course of a few weeks or months, learners meet the kanji and realize the harsh truth: it will take years of hard work to _begin_ to master the kanji in all their phonological and semantic complexity. This leads into another, more dangerous trap. At this stage, when so much about kanji is new and surprising, learners are wont to ***over*estimate the difficulty of learning the kanji**. The whole task of learning Japanese can start to feel impossible, and learners may give up altogether, as I once did myself.

_Kanjisense_ helps learners of Japanese stay on track by acting as a graphic compass they can use to orient themselves on their journey of learning to read and write the kanji.
Its web interface makes it possible to visualize at a glance one's general progress in learning the kanji, as well as one's mastery of individual characters on the level of their sound, meaning, and graphical structure. It combines a **dictionary app** with an introduction to the **graphic analysis** of the kanji characters, presented by means of a design language purpose-built to illuminate the **graphic and phonetic relationships between characters**, so that even total beginners and people studying on their own can get their bearings as they progress towards acquiring the approximately 3500 characters needed for adult-level literacy in Japanese.
