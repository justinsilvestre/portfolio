## Addressing some accessibility problems in Classical Chinese education

A user interface like that of Hanlib is particularly helpful for a language like Classical Chinese for a number of reasons. One reason is that a few features of the language make it particularly _hard to parse_, such as a lack of standard punctuation, ambiguity between proper nouns vs. ordinary words, and perhaps most vexingly, **heavy use of allusion**.

> In [Classical] Chinese texts the literary allusions often not only add to one’s aesthetic appreciation of a passage, **they are essential even for the grammatically correct
> parsing and the elementary understanding of passages**. In English one will grammatically understand a sentence even when one fails to recognise a biblical or other allusion that occurs in it and gives the sentence a special force or a specific reference. In [Classical] Chinese, the texts as they stand often do not begin to make any sense until you get the allusions.

But even the texts from which those allusions are drawn were often full of interpretive challenges themselves. It sounds hard to believe for someone not familiar with the Classical Chinese literary culture, but **readers of canonical texts are traditionally not expected to understand them without ample external help** in the form of commentaries. These commentaries are often interspersed with the text itself, serving not only to give background and context, but at times also to **disambiguate the basic syntactic structure** of the main text. This is necessary largely due to the _fluidity of parts of speech_ in Classical Chinese. Most words can function as any number of parts of speech, with _context alone_ determining whether a word like 人 is to be interpreted as "a person", "other people", "to regard as human", "to act as a person", or a number of other possibilities. More than in other languages with generally fixed parts of speech (like Indo-European languages), the syntax of words can be hard to pin down, even with a good reference grammar and dictionary on hand. Thus, the word-popover interface in Hanlib acts not only as a dictionary, but also as a **tool for syntactic disambiguation** in the same vein as the traditional commentaries, but in a more interactive and user-friendly format.

Speaking of reference works on Classical Chinese, there are painfully few of them available in non-East-Asian languages. What's more, they can be prohibitively expensive even when their quality pales in comparison to the mid-range Classical Chinese dictionaries available in modern Chinese and Japanese. In theory, knowledge of modern Chinese shouldn't be a prerequisite for knowledge of Classical Chinese, no more than knowledge of French or Italian is a prerequisite for knowledge of Latin. But in reality, authors of Classical Chinese textbooks in English usually assume their readers are proficient in modern Chinese. It's **a double-reinforced language barrier** preventing speakers of English and other languages from accessing this important literary tradition firsthand. Hanlib aims to improve this situation by providing a way for English-speakers to engage with Classical Chinese texts, even if they have no prior knowledge of the Chinese language or Chinese characters.
