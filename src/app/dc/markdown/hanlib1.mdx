## Shedding light on the Classical Chinese literary tradition
The above passage was the first thing that came to mind when I started reading _Understanding Computers and Cognition_. In that 1986 book, authors Winograd and Flores invoke thinkers like Heidegger to expound a skepticism towards the "rationalist tradition" which views language (and knowledge in general) as a representation of an objective reality. The _Zhuangzi_ is thousands of years old, but, like other texts in the Classical Chinese literary tradition, it abounds with such passages which call into question our everyday understanding of language and meaning, describing notions of a fluidity of identity that clearly resonate with thought of the 20th century and since. At times, the resonances are uncanny. Some have even outright accused Heidegger of plagiarizing from the [_Zhuangzi_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_Tea#cite_ref-Imamichi_5-0) and the [_Laozi_](https://philosophyandpsychology.wordpress.com/2010/03/18/heidegger-ripping-off-taoism/). Whether or not such plagiarism actually occurred, there's clearly potential for rich discourse between ancient Chinese thought and modern philosophy, and we westerners would do well to explore it further.

However, in order to explore this potential to its fullest, we need to be able to read these ancient texts in the original language. And this poses a greater challenge than the uninitiated might expect. This project _Hanlib_ represents my efforts to make Classical Chinese texts more accessible to modern readers. Using a modern web-based UI on top of a homegrown domain-specific language (DSL) for **automatically generating interactive glosses of Classical Chinese texts**, I hope to provide a way for readers to engage with Classical Chinese texts no matter their particular linguistic background. It is still in the early stages, but the core functionality is already complete, and you can see how automatically generated interactive glosses have been generated for a number of passages on the site.
