## Shedding light on the Classical Chinese literary tradition


The texts of the Classical Chinese literary tradition abound with thought-provoking passages which call into question our everyday understanding of language and meaning, and passages which describe notions of a fluidity of identity that clearly resonate with thought of the 20th century and since. 
In the passage above, it's not hard to see echoes of the same ideas put forward in 1986 in _Understanding Computers and Cognition_, where authors Winograd and Flores invoke thinkers like Heidegger to expound a skepticism towards the "rationalist tradition" which views language (and knowledge in general) as a representation of an objective reality. It's clear that there's **potential for rich discourse here** that's worth exploring.

However, in order to explore this potential to its fullest, we need to be able to read these ancient texts in the original language. And this poses a greater challenge than the uninitiated might expect. This project _Hanlib_ represents my efforts to make Classical Chinese texts more accessible to modern readers. Using a modern web-based UI on top of a homegrown domain-specific language (DSL) for **automatically generating interactive glosses of Classical Chinese texts**, I hope to provide a way for readers to engage with Classical Chinese texts no matter their particular linguistic background. It is still in the early stages, but the core functionality is already complete, and you can see how automatically generated interactive glosses have been generated for a number of passages on the site.
