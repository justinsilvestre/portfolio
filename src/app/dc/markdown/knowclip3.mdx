I published the first version Knowclip in 2020 as a free and open-source app hoping that as many people as possible might benefit from it, but at its heart, it was the app that _I wished existed_ when I was studying Japanese as a beginner in 2020. By this measure, it was a success: using Knowclip as my primary tool for learning vocabulary words, I managed in 2024 to pass the highest level "N1" of the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (roughly equivalent to a C1 certificate in the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages). But most importantly, I can enjoy Japanese media and have conversations with native speakers with no problem now, which was my goal all along. I still have a lot to learn, but since I've reached my personal goal with Japanese, **I've basically "graduated" from using Knowclip myself**. This in itself is a sign that Knowclip has succeeded in not only its mission as a language-learning tool, but also as a protest against the state of modern language-learning software. It's a piece of software that doesn't fight for your attention, and lets you go freely when you're ready to move on.

While my own progress in my Japanese studies is the main motivation for slowing down Knowclip's development, there are other factors as well. A number of challenges have made me start to doubt whether it's possible in the long term to maintain my vision of Knowclip as a _stable_ offline-first user experience accessible for everyone.

One challenge is **maintenance of dependencies**. In order to provide a modern user experience, I had to rely on a number of libraries, which in turn have their own dependencies. This is what made it possible to rapidly develop Knowclip as a cross-platform application on my own. But the same JavaScript ecosystem that made that possible is notorious for being in a state of constant flux. (This is the source of the infamous ["JavaScript fatigue"](https://auth0.com/blog/how-to-manage-javascript-fatigue/#What-is-JavaScript-Fatigue-)) This means that time I would like to spend on refining the user experience often ends up spent just on updating dependencies so that the app will still run on the latest operating systems. While it is possible *in theory* to remove these dependencies to produce an archive-friendly user experience, this would make it impossible to develop Knowclip on my own. What we regard as basic UI features, which we are all used to from the modern web, are actually the result of indirect collaboration of massive groups of developers.

Additionally, though anyone with a modern computer can download and use Knowclip, its accessibility is limited in practice by the **accessibility of video content**. The kind of video content that would be most useful for language learners, like TV shows, movies, and YouTube videos, can't easily be redistributed legally even if it's done for educational purposes and without profit. Companies like Meta and OpenAI have made headlines recently for their attempts to flout intellectual property laws for the purposes of training their LLMs, but this is an option only available to big companies with the resources to fight legal battles, and even then, it's morally questionable. For now, in order to use Knowclip to its full potential, users need to be savvy enough to bring their own downloaded video content. Though there may be legal _and_ ethical ways to improve this part of the user experience, it's doubtful that they would satisfy the criterion of providing an _archive-friendly_ user experience.

Finally, there's the question of whether it is just **encouraging the same shallow engagement with media** that it was meant to combat. I set out to make a language-learning tool that works to help users _engage deeply_ with media, and I maintain that it works to some degree, judging by my own experience. But in the end, when users are doing their flashcard drills in Anki, they end up experiencing that content in the form of short audio clips. In some ways, this is similar to apps like TikTok, where users scroll through short video clips. I think there is much more that could be done to help users engage with the content in a more meaningful way, before the final step of flashcard drills.

If I am to continue making Knowclip available to the public, these are challenges I'll have to address on an ongoing basis. I've been focusing on other projects for a while now, but until I return to Knowclip, I'm satisfied in having created a tool that at least myself and a few others have found useful in our personal language-learning journeys.
