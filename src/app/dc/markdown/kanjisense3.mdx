## A design language for illuminating relationships between characters

<KanjisenseUiStructureElements />

Wherever a character appears in the Kanjisense user interface, **visual cues** help the user instantly discern certain important aspects of its relationships with other characters. One major element of this system consists of **enclosing shapes** around characters in the UI. Kanji components, i.e. graphic building blocks which are used to form multiple different kanji, are shown in a **circle**, and standalone characters are shown in a **square**. These shapes were chosen so that they can combine in an intuitive way to highlight those graphic elements which double as components _and_ standalone characters.

Another important element of the design language is the **color** associated with characters and their components, which hints at the **frequency of use** of a given character or component. For example, characters in a **blue hue** constitute **the most commonly used** character set, derived from the Japanese government's elementary-school-level kanji lists. Characters in a **red hue** are **the rarest** of the characters still in general use (belonging to no important government lists except the "Name-Use Kanji" list which sanctions the use of kanji in names). These lists have their shortcomings, some of which I touched on above. Another shortcoming is that they don't always reflect a character's actual usefulness in real-world contexts. For example, the character **禾** (rice plant) is not included in the elementary school list, but it is a very common component of other characters. On the other hand, the character **蚕** (silkworm) is included in the elementary school list, but it is extremely rare in actual use. To mitigate some of these shortcomings, I used the **brightness** of those colors as an additional cue. This gives a rough idea of the character's frequency of use _as a standalone character or as a component_.

These and other visual cues give learners an instant sense of which characters are of greatest interest to them at their particular stage of learning. Without the guidance of a teacher, or an algorithmically generated content feed, it's possible for anyone learning Japanese to use the Kanjisense app in a way personalized to their own needs by simply following the shapes and colors that suit them best at their current level.
