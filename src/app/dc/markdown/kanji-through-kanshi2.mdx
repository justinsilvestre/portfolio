## _Kanji through Kanshi_ as an introduction to Classical Chinese

In the title _Kanji through Kanshi_, the Japanese word for the Chinese characters _kanji_ is used here (as it often is in English) to evoke the Chinese characters specifically as used in Japanese. Likewise, _kanshi_ is the Japanese term for Classical Chinese poems. With this title, I aim to convey that my target audience is specifically learners of Japanese and they are welcome to consider the _kanji_ themselves as the sole object of study. But even so, because these Classical Chinese poems are always front and center, this is also in effect an **introductory course in Classical Chinese language and literature**. As such, in deciding on a methodology for developing this course, I've taken into consideration not only the current state of kanji-learning resources (which has resulted in the [offshoot project Kanjisense](/dc/kanjisense)), but also the current state of resources for learning Classical Chinese. I aim to improve the landscape of English-speakers' Classical Chinese learning resources by **utilizing software to facilitate a more _translation-reliant_ approach** like that which has been proven to work in conventional Classical Chinese education in East Asia.

This conventional approach to Classical Chinese education in Japan and China consists of the following. Gradually, texts of increasing complexity are presented **alongside glosses and idiomatic translations** into students' native language. Grammar is discussed at times to clarify certain tricky points, mostly around a closed, non-inflecting class of words called _grammatical particles_. (This is different from traditional grammar education in the west, which derives from the Latin tradition and focuses heavily on proper inflectional treatment of verbs, nouns, adjectives, etc.) In this approach, students acquire the syntax of the language basically without explicit discussion of how to syntactically analyze a Classical Chinese sentence. This approach is markedly different from the **syntax-first** approach that has become a trend in Classical Chinese textbooks for English speakers published in recent years, like Van Norden's _Classical Chinese for Everyone_ (2019) and Vogelsang's _Introduction to Classical Chinese_ (2021). These books aim to train students in the syntactic analysis of Chinese sentences, and then texts are presented with little to no accompanying translations. The advantage of this approach would seem to be that, with no idiomatic English translation to use as a crutch, students are forced to engage with a text on its own terms. But in my experience, more than drawing the focus to the Chinese text, this syntax-first approach draws focus to textbook authors' syntactic analysis, which is often idiosyncratic and explained with novel terminology. This method of explicit syntactic analysis constitutes _an extra layer of material for students to learn_ on top of the Chinese script, vocabulary, and grammar. Before extracting any meaning from the textbook's passages, they need to work quite hard to extract meaning from the author's arcane grammatical explanations.

I was convinced of the effectiveness of the more traditional translation-reliant approach to Classical Chinese education through my own introduction to the language, Archie Barnes' _Chinese through Poetry_ (2001). This book distinguishes itself from the above-mentioned textbooks in its heavy use of translations as one important tool for illuminating texts' meaning. Barnes' work also stands out for its focus on short but unabridged poems, rather than extracts of philosophic works. These classic poems are full of vivid imagery and catchy rhythm, making them perfectly suited to help new words and characters stick in the memory. In my work, I aim to take Barnes' approach further, to create a course that is viable as a _standalone resource for learning the Chinese characters_ as well as the basics of Classical Chinese. In part, this means allowing students of all skill levels to engage directly with a variety of texts by providing them with **a modern user-friendly interface for reading glossed texts** (see Hanlib ===========LINK=========== for some of the results of my work in this area). But I also aim to take Barnes' approach further by **using authentic medieval Chinese poems _from the very start_ and in _higher volume_**.
