These days, the norm of the web is ephemerality. What started out as a diffuse network of hypertext pages has coalesced into a diffuse network of denser networks of "content", no longer presented in discrete pages, but rather drip-fed to end-users from infinite feeds at a pace algorithmically dictated above all by large corporate interests. This is not only the case for social media, but even for sites and applications meant to serve as educational resources. As tech companies try to stay afloat in ever-changing markets and to deliver on promises to wealthy investors, the experience of end users is constantly shifting and shuffling. This in turn puts **a hard limit on the web's potential as a medium for education**. How can we expect this medium to deepen our understanding of any topic, when it won't even let us linger on one for more than a few seconds? For language education, the situation is especially dire, since progress in language learning only happens through deep engagement with material in the target language. 

Knowclip is my personal protest against the toxic ephemerality of today's Internet, specifically in the sphere of language education. It's a desktop app, but it's built almost exclusively with ubiquitous web technologies: the user interface is built using an implementation of Google's _Material Design_ system written in Meta's React UI framework. Through the use of these technologies, it recreates in many ways the same kind of snappy, smooth user experience which modern web-app users are used to, but it applies them to a purpose diametrically opposed to that of modern social media apps: rather than dispersing the user's attention throughout an endless stream of content, it **focuses users' attention on one single piece of content** until they have parts of it memorized by heart.
