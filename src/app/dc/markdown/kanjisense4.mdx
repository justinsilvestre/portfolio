## A new system of graphic analysis specifically for kanji learners

At this point, I consider the design language to be basically complete, since it functions on the levels described above. But I hesitate to say that Kanjisense as a whole is a finished product. What might be described as the true heart of Kanjisense is still under development&mdash;that is, the **graphic analysis of the kanji** which classifies and names the kanji and their components.

Similarly to the question of what it means to "know" a kanji, **the question of what counts as a "standalone kanji" vs. a "kanji component"** has no official or straightforward answer. Different people have different ways of breaking down the kanji into components. In order to begin to create a dictionary app which illuminates the structural relationships between kanji and their graphic components in the ways touched on above, I first had to decide on _how to define a kanji and a kanji component_. For learners, it makes sense to treat certain characters and components as "variants" of each other. In addition, it's helpful to point out when certain "sound components" offer clues to the pronunciation of characters.

While I did use existing sets of character composition data, variant character data, and phonological data as a starting point for my own graphical analysis of the kanji, these were all created for different purposes than teaching the kanji. A bulk of the work in getting to this point was **structuring and editing the core data** around which the dictionary app is built, and augmenting it with semantic and [phonetic data](https://kanjisense.com/browse/sound-components). At this point, with the core dataset centered on the 270 "atomic components" mentioned above, it has reached a certain level of stability, but it still needs refinement before I can consider it close to finished. For instance, one part of refining this dataset involves making it adaptable to the needs of Chinese learners as well. This has been a goal since the beginning, which has informed various design decisions (not only in the UI design, but also in the code).

Until I can consider the graphic analysis finished, I take comfort in the fact that I've created a functional dictionary app that not only acts as a tool for looking up kanji in a friendly, helpful UI, but also acts as a space for kanji learners to **freely explore the relationships between kanji**. I think this is the first time it's ever been so easy to jump from one kanji to another and discover all their shapes, meanings, and sounds to convey a sense of the beauty and the depth of this unique ancient script, even to the most novice learners.
