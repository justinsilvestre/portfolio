## Curating Classical Chinese poems for the course

A large bulk of the work in creating this course has been **curating a suitable selection of poems**. If students who complete the course should be familiar with the majority of the most important kanji (i.e. at least a thousand characters), this will require at least a hundred short poems, with a steady number of new characters introduced per poem. This is hard work not only because of the high volume of characters and poems to introduce; it's also a delicate balancing act, since the progress from lesson to lesson can be neither too slow nor too fast. Spikes in difficulty can be overwhelming for learners.

In order to easily check for spikes in difficulty, I decided to use software to monitor each poem's difficulty from lesson to lesson. A given poem's difficulty is determined not only by the number of new characters introduced (which is easy to measure), but also by the **graphic complexity of those characters** (which is harder to measure). So in order to efficiently curate this selection of poem, I first had to devise a way to measure the graphic complexity of a given text. This work eventually resulted in the system of graphic analysis at the heart of the [Kanjisense dictionary app](/dc/kanjisense). This method of automatically graphically analyzing texts doesn't take into account other aspects of a poem's difficulty (e.g. difficult grammar or heavy use of allusions), but even so, it has made the process of curating these poems infinitely easier.

Now, I've arrived at a selection of about 150 poems which fulfill the basic criteria of character count and graphic complexity. The current stage of the curation process involves **arranging the poems into thematic groups**. These poems involve a diverse array of themes and images, and many of these require a certain amount of background knowledge to appreciate fully, so arranging the poems in thematic groups will make it clearer for students when certain thematic elements are being used in a poem. For example, the image of the plum blossom is associated with the transition from winter to spring in Chinese poetry, but those unfamiliar with this cultural association can't easily appreciate the significance of this cultural association by just hearing about it once and seeing it in a single poem. But by seeing the word for "plum" used in a number of poems back to back, students can naturally internalize both the plum's symbolic significance and the character/word for "plum" at the same time. Thus thematic groups help learners both to understand the poems and to learn the characters. Organizing the poems in this way is a slow process, since the rearranging of poems can affect the difficulty progression from lesson to lesson, but I have been making steady progress over the past year or so.

Gradually, I'm working my way towards having a course progression that is both thematically coherent and well balanced. Once I am happy with my selection of poems, I will write glosses for them using the [utilities I published under the name Hanlib](/dc/hanlib) and integrate that UI with the graphic character analysis system from [Kanjisense](/dc/kanjisense). Those projects broke off on natural fault lines within the larger Kanji through Kanshi project, as salient user-facing aspects of the course. But since the curation of the poems is a basically private endeavor, that part of the project remains unpublished, though the source code is available on Github), in the [same repository](https://github.com/justinsilvestre/kanjisense/blob/main/app/routes/curate.%24courseId.tsx) as the Kanjisense source.

My own status as a newcomer to Classical Chinese literature (having studied it on my own for about seven years) has proven to be an asset when it comes to curating these poems, as I need only consult to myself to judge whether a given text is suitably interesting for newcomers. But, being without any formal education in Classical Chinese literature and language, I am well aware that I have much to learn. I'm lucky that there is a large body of reference works on Classical Chinese literature available in Japanese, which I consult as much as possible. Many poems are fully glossed in Japanese, offering not only literal translations, but even syntactic analyses and background information on the poems and their authors. Of course, not all poems in the corpus are translated and analyzed. But something great about the Classical Chinese poetic tradition is that so many poems are short (the quatrain being a common form) and rely on imagery that remains simple even when conveying several layers of meaning simultaneously. This aspect of the Chinese literary aesthetic makes these poems ideal vehicles for introducing vocabulary, but it also makes many of them easy to appreciate for their literary merit. This is the final goal of the course: **to use the kanji as a bridge to the Classical Chinese literary tradition**, so that students can appreciate the beauty of these poems in their original language.

It's a big project, and I have no set time frame for when I will finish it. But in the meantime, I'm enjoying the process of immersing myself in these ancient texts and seeing what gems I can find. Even if my appreciation of these poems is shallow compared to that of an expert, I'm excited to share a little bit of the joy I have found in them with others.
