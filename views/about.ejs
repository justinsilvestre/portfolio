<p>Justin first started making websites in middle school as a way to show off his artwork and experiments in Flash.</p>

<p>When it came time to choose what to study in college, his other passion, language, won out over art. He set out to become a professor, but four years immersed in academia was enough to change his mind.</p>

<p>Early in 2015, he discovered Rails. Suddenly, everything that baffled him as a kid trying to grapple with PHP and SQL made perfect sense. Web development wasn't just about writing code, he realized&mdash;it could be just the outlet he needed to satisfy his creative impulse. He decided to learn everything he could about web development, dedicating himself full-time to learning Ruby and JavaScript so that he could create beautiful, useful things every day.</p>
